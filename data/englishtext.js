    "One morning my friend and I were thinking about how we could plan our summer break away from school. Driving from our own state to several nearby states would help to expand our limited funds. Inviting six other friends to accompany us would lower our car expenses. Stopping at certain sites would also help us stretch our truly limited travel budget. Yesterday I engaged in an interesting and enlightening discussion about finances. I found it difficult to imagine that during my lifetime I might well earn at least one-half million dollars. It is also possible that I might spend as much as one-half million during the same period. The really difficult thing for me to do will be to save more of the half-million than I spend. Thinking about today's high cost of living makes this seem an impossible task for most. Last week I asked a friend to talk with me and a girl-friend about college.",
    "Hunt and peck (two-fingered typing), also known as Eagle Finger, is a common form of typing in which the typist presses each key individually. Instead of relying on the memorized position of keys, the typist must find each key by sight. Use of this method may also prevent the typist from being able to see what has been typed without glancing away from the keys. Although good accuracy may be achieved, any typing errors that are made may not be noticed immediately due to the user not looking at the screen. There is also the disadvantage that because fewer fingers are used, those that are used are forced to move a much greater distance.",
    "The only way to type with speed and accuracy is to use all ten fingers. To learn the right fingering technique, use a method adapted to your keyboard.",
    "On a bright and sunny morning, my close friend and I began brainstorming our plans for the upcoming summer vacation, away from the confines of school and homework. We hatched a brilliant idea to embark on a road trip, venturing from our home state to explore neighboring states. Our primary motivation was to maximize the value of our limited financial resources. To make the journey more enjoyable and cost-effective, we decided to invite six of our dearest friends to join us on this exciting adventure.",
    "We understood that the more people we had, the cheaper the travel expenses per person, making it easier for everyone to participate. Our strategy for making the trip more economical also included making stops at interesting and budget-friendly destinations along the way. We were determined to make every dollar count and ensure that our funds stretched as far as possible. In doing so, we hoped to create lasting memories that would be well worth the investment.",
    "Just yesterday, I engaged in a thought-provoking discussion about personal finances. It was a conversation that opened my eyes to the possibilities that lie ahead in life. I pondered the idea that over the course of my lifetime, I might realistically have the opportunity to earn at least one-half million dollars. However, the flip side of that coin was the realization that I could very well spend a comparable amount during the same period.",
    "The true challenge, it seemed, would be in saving more of the half-million than I spent. As I reflected on the current high cost of living, it made the task appear almost insurmountable. Yet, I remained hopeful that with careful planning and wise financial decisions, I could secure a stable and prosperous future.",
    "Last week, I reached out to a close friend and a girl-friend to engage in a meaningful conversation about our plans for college and the exciting journey ahead. It was a discussion filled with hope, dreams, and the promise of new beginnings.",
